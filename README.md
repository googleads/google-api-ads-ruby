# Ad Manager SOAP API Client Libraries for Ruby

## Getting started

1. Install the library using RubyGems.

        $ gem install google-dfp-api

1. Copy the sample config file to your home directory and fill out the
required properties.

  * [ad_manager_api.yml](https://github.com/googleads/google-api-ads-ruby/blob/HEAD/ad_manager_api/ad_manager_api.yml)

authentication mechanism. Follow the appropriate guide below based on your use
case.
