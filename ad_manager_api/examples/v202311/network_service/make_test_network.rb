# This example creates a test network. You do not need to have an Ad Manager
# account to run this example, but you do need to have a Google account (created
# at http://www.google.com/accounts/newaccount if you currently don't have one)
# that is not associated with any other Ad Manager test networks (including old
# sandbox networks). Once this network is created, you can supply the network
# code in your settings to make calls to other services.
#
# Please see the following URL for more information:
#   https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/docs/signup
#
# Alternatively, if you do not wish to run this example, you can create a test
# network at: https://ad_manager-playground.appspot.com
